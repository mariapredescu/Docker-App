1. Go into the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located
2. Run the command: docker-compose up --build
3. Run the command: docker ps 
4. Identify the container ID for the client/admin service
5. Run the command: docker attach <client-ID> or docker attach <admin-ID>
6. After you have finished using the app run the following command to stop the containers: docker-compose down

Command 5 will start the client/admin service and now you can type "start" to begin using the app.
